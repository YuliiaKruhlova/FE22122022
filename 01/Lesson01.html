        Spotlight on: winter’s festive season in Kyiv
    </h1>
    <h3> 
        Kyiv may not be the first city that comes to mind for Christmas travel. 
        <br> However, visiting the Ukrainian capital during the festive season may change your mind completely. 
        <br>In December and January, this eastern European metropolis becomes a sparkling winter wonderland, 
        <br> with a variety of cozy markets and tasty street food, not to mention its impressive ancient cathedrals and 
        <br> traditional celebrations.

        Get into the festive spirit on St Nicholas Day
    </h2>
    <p>
        Ukraine celebrates St Nicholas Day on 19 December. 
        <br> This day feels like a rehearsal of Christmas, with people gifting each other sweet treats. 
        <br> A few days earlier, on 16 December, the Christmas fair at historic Kontraktova Ploscha in Kyiv 
        <br> officially brings the holiday spirit to the capital, with pretty rows of wooden houses selling various local delights,
        <br> handmade goods and warm wine.

<h2>
    Experience traditional Orthodox Christmas
</h2>
<p>
    While the celebration of New Year has a party feel, Christmas in Kyiv is a whole other story. 
    <br> This is a more solemn holiday focusing on the family and tradition. 
    <br> As the majority of the Ukrainian population is Orthodox, Christmas is celebrated according to the Julian calendar on 7 January. 
    <br> One of the most important traditions is Svyatyi Vechir (Holy Supper), 
    <br> when families gather around the dinner table with 12 dishes representing 12 months of the year. 
    <br>  To get a sense of this holiday’s true spirit in the authentic setting of a Ukrainian village, 
    <br>  head to the <strong>  <a href="Pyrohiv.html"> Pyrohiv Museum of Folk Architecture </a> </strong> which organises a Christmas celebration with singing,
    <br>  dancing and sampling of festive dishes.
