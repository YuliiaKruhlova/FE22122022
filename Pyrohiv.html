    <h1>
        Pyrohiv Museum of Folk Architecture
    </h1>
    <h3>
       Some 300 traditional structures, some dating back to the 16th century, 
       <br> have been transplanted form various parts of Ukraine to this open-air folk museum. Yes. 
       <br> On weekends in the warm months, medieval-themed events and contests take place and 
       <br> the entire compound assumes a festive atmosphere, with much singing, dancing and eating going on. 
       <br> It's about 12km south of central Kyiv; marshrutka 496 from Lukyanivska metro station takes you right to the entrance.
    </h3>
       <p>
In the summer workers enact different village roles, carving wood, making pottery, doing embroidery, and driving horses and carts.
<br> Other activities include a zipline (100uah), horse riding and archery. 
<br> There is a cluster of outdoor eateries at the centre of the action that serve wonderful shashlyk (shish kebab) and all manner of traditional Ukrainian food 
<br> and drink. Ukrainian musicians play on weekends.
</p>
<p>
The quaint 17th- to 20th-century wooden churches, cottages, farmsteads and windmills are divided into seven 'villages' representing regional areas of Ukraine. 
<br> So in just one long afternoon you can visit the architecture of eastern, western and southern Ukraine.

    <em> 
It's always fun, especially so if you visit during a festival. 
<br> Pyrohovo hosts several, the biggest of which is the countrywide Ivan Kupala festival.
